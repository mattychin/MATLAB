# MATLAB project: Predator Prey Dynamics

This file contains the MATLAB scripts I wrote for a project on studying the usefulness and limitations of the Lotka-Volterra model.

Fur_Pelts_1900_to_1920.xlsx = Raw data collected by Hydson Bay Company on hare and lynx populations from 1900 to 1920.
ParamFittingAndStability.m = MATLAB script to fit parameters to the predator-prey model and implement stability analysis
ParamResponse.m = MATLAB script to test for response of the model with different perturbations
lotka_volterra.m = MATLAB function to simulate a 3-parameter Lotka-Volterra model
lotka_volterra_param.m = MATLAB function to simulate a 3-parameter Lotka-Volterra model that accepts externally specified parameter
